In my early analysis of the first 32 libraries I ran the leafcutter differential isoform tool. I am now going to rerun this with the peaks called from the 28 individuals. These peaks have been created with the Peak pipeline in https://brimittleman.github.io/threeprimeseq/peak.cov.pipeline.html. These are also the peaks used for the initial QTL analysis. https://brimittleman.github.io/threeprimeseq/apaQTLwLeafcutter.html. I can use the same phenotype and genotype files from this analysis. 


To run the differential isoform analysis I need a file with the lines numbers and the fraction. This is similar to the sample.txt file from the QTL analysis.  

The phenotype file is filtered_APApeaks_merged_allchrom_refseqGenes_pheno.txt. I can use the header of this to create the sample form. I will work in the directory: /project2/gilad/briana/threeprimeseq/data/diff_iso/  


make_samplegroups.py
```{bash, eval=F}

outfile=open("/project2/gilad/briana/threeprimeseq/data/diff_iso/sample_groups.txt", "w")
infile=open("/project2/gilad/briana/threeprimeseq/data/diff_iso/filtered_APApeaks_merged_allchrom_refseqGenes_pheno.txt", "r")

for ln, i in enumerate(infile):
    if ln==0:
        header=i.split()
        lines=header[1:]
        for l in lines:
            if l[-1] == "T":
                outfile.write("%s\tTotal\n"%(l))
            else:

                outfile.write("%s\tNuclear\n"%(l))
                
outfile.close()
                

```

I can now run the leafcutter_ds.R file.  

run_leafcutter_ds.sh

```{bash, eval=F}

Problem may be due to the phenotype file. It looks like the header does not need a PeakID column.
