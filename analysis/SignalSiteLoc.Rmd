In the [Signal Site enrichment analysis](SignalSiteEnrich.html) I looked at the peaks to see if signal sites are enriched upstream of my peaks. I found this is true but now I want to see where the signal sites are in comparison to my peaks. I am going to use the biostrings package tool matchPWM for this analysis.

##Make location file
I need to get the coordinates for the regions I care about. I want to look at the peak and 150bp upstream. This is probably larger than I will need  to look at but it will be good to have an inclusive look first.
