In this analysis I want to test macs2 as a potential peak caller in the 3' seq data. This is a widely used peak caller for chip seq data.  

I have to create a specific environment to install macs2 because you need to use python 2.7. I call it macs-env. To access this environment I use source activate macs-env.
